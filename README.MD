# PICAM-API

A personal project to make a raspberry PI take a picture via an API request.

## Description

a mobile app makes a request to the endpoint using a Unique Identified (capture ID).
the foto is captured and stored with the captureID in the file name.
the foto is uploaded to imgur and the link is sent to the user. 
this will probably take too long, but I'll deal with that in a later stage.
